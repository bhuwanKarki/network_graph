They conclude that pediatric residents do not receive proper training on use of medical interpreters, and suggest updating residency training curricula. The authors do not address their selection bias for programs in areas of high limited English proficiency (LEP), which likely led to overestimating pediatric residents&#x02019; proficiency in working with interpreters. With nearly 10% of the U.S. population having LEP, and increased medical access for members of racial and ethnic minority groups resulting from the enactment of the Affordable Care Act,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> these findings present a sobering view of our next generation of physicians&#x02019; ability to communicate well with many of their patients. To be fully prepared to treat an increasingly diverse population of patients, we believe that all physicians-in-training should receive formal global health training in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education.</p><p>Over the last decade, many medical schools have incorporated global health teaching in their curricula, and people have suggested creating global health competencies.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> At Harvard Medical School, all first-year students take a social medicine and global health course, which includes lectures and group discussions on health inequalities and social determinants of health, among other topics. While these principles are a fundamental part of medical education, they must be reinforced on a more practical level during postgraduate training.</p><p>Postgraduate training programs for global health should be structured, standardized, and universal.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Thompson et al highlight one of many skills that are missing from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education&#x02019;s six core competencies. Standardizing global health training through measured competencies would generate better physicians while improving the delivery of medical care. All physicians should possess these skills, and the perils of not teaching them to residents will continue to impede proper medical care for all people.</p></sec><sig-block><sig>Paul K.
