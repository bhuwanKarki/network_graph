The authors developed and validated an instrument to assess clinical trainers as role models: the Role Model Apperception Tool (RoMAT).</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>On the basis of a 2011 systematic review of the literature and through consultation with medical education experts and with clinical trainers and trainees, the authors developed 17 attributes characterizing a role model, to be assessed using a Likert scale. In 2012, general practice (GP) trainees, in their first or third year of postgraduate training, who attended a curriculum day at four institutes in different parts of the Netherlands, completed the RoMAT. The authors performed a principal component analysis on the data that were generated, and they tested the instrument&#x02019;s validity and reliability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 328 potential GP trainees, 279 (85%) participated. Of these, 202 (72%) were female, and 154 (55%) were first-year trainees. The RoMAT demonstrated both content and convergent validity. Two components were extracted: &#x0201c;Caring Attitude&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Effectiveness.&#x0201d; Both components had high reliability scores (0.92 and 0.84, respectively). Less experienced trainees scored their trainers significantly higher on the Caring Attitude component.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The RoMAT proved to be a valid, reliable instrument for assessing clinical trainers&#x02019; role-modeling behavior. Both components include an equal number of items addressing personal (Heart), teaching (Head), and clinical (Hands-on) qualities, thus demonstrating that competence in the &#x0201c;3Hs&#x0201d; is a condition for positive role modeling.

Yet, in many small clinical settings (e.g., general practitioner [GP] training practices), only one or two clinical trainers are available. The absence of multiple role models, whom a trainee can compare against one another, may increase the trainee&#x02019;s risk of imitating negative role models. To recognize which of their trainers&#x02019; role model behaviors they should imitate, trainees need an apperception<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> assessment tool. Such a tool could allow trainees to discriminate between positive and negative role modeling. In addition, an educational manager (e.g., residency director) could also use a role modeling assessment tool to evaluate and provide feedback to individual clinical trainers about their role modeling, thereby enabling them to examine and improve their role-modeling behaviors.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Many tools have already been developed for assessing clinical trainers as medical educators; these include the Cleveland Clinic Teaching Effectiveness Instrument (CCTEI),<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> the System for the Evaluation of Teaching Qualities instrument,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and the Clinical Teaching Assessment Instrument.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Two tools (the Evaluation and Feedback For Effective Clinical Teaching instrument<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and the Maastricht Clinical Teaching Questionnaire<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>) even address specifically whether a clinical trainer should be considered a role model. Because they do not assess particular attributes of role modeling (as opposed to teaching or mentoring), these tools do not identify negative role modeling as such and cannot help trainees avoid imitating negative behaviors.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, these tools offer no possibilities for providing specific feedback on which aspects of the role model function could be improved.</p><p>This study therefore aims to develop and validate a tool for assessing various aspects of the clinical trainer as a role model.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Context</title><p>In order to work independently as a GP in the Netherlands, physicians who have graduated from a bachelor&#x02013;master curriculum at a university must complete three years of additional specialty training. During the first and third years of this training, each of these doctors works as a trainee in a primary care practice four days each week, supervised by at least one GP, the clinical trainer. In the second year, each physician works in a variety of clinical settings, usually with more than two clinical trainers. Central curriculum sessions, which cover all CanMEDS skills and topics, are organized at one of the eight Dutch institutes for GP specialty training. GPs and behavioral scientists (both called &#x0201c;teachers&#x0201d;&#x02014;not to be confused with trainers) provide the instruction. The sessions are held one day each week for all GP trainees and eight days each year (for faculty development) for all GP trainers.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>We conducted this study among GP trainees at four of the Dutch institutes for GP specialty training. These four, located in Amsterdam, Nijmegen, Maastricht, and Leiden, represented the Netherlands geographically, and also provided a good number of different GP training practices and settings. The potential participants (n = 328) comprised the first and third-year GP trainees attending one of the central curriculum sessions during the first four months of 2012. We invited all the trainees who were present on the day we distributed the questionnaires.</p><p>We instructed the participants to complete the questions keeping their primary clinical trainer in mind. We informed all of the GP trainees about the nature of the study, and we assured them that participation was voluntary and that the questionnaires would be coded to protect anonymity. We offered no incentives. Each participating trainee signed an informed consent form. We stored all informed consent forms and other identifiers (separately from the forms) in a locked cabinet under the control of the head of the research department (M.W-dW.). We obtained ethical approval for this study from the ethical review board of the NVMO (Dutch Association for Medical Education).</p></sec><sec><title>Development and administration of the instrument</title><p>We developed the survey instrument in three stages. First, we conducted a systematic review of all available original studies published through May 2011 that provided attributes of clinical trainers as role models.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> We organized and ranked our list of attributes (e.g., &#x0201c;Knowledge acquisition and clinical thought processes&#x0201d;) according to both the frequency of their occurrence in the included studies, and their importance as indicated in these studies.</p><p>In the second stage, we combined like attributes and transformed them into questionnaire items. They were then translated into Dutch (based partly on translations obtained from a Dutch article),<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> adapted to cover all of the identified attributes, and assessed by experts: two clinical trainers, two teachers of GP trainees, two faculty developers of GP trainers, and two researchers (N.v.D., M.W-dW.). These eight experts performed a critical assessment of whether collectively the potential questionnaire items accurately summarized and characterized the original attributes identified through the systematic review. They also considered whether the items were clearly worded and whether they were sufficiently relevant to warrant inclusion in the instrument.</p><p>Finally, second-year trainees pretested the resulting concept instrument in a focus group setting. In one of two focus groups, the trainees, instructed to consider one of their past clinical trainers, completed the instrument using a five-point Likert scale, whilst freely expressing and discussing their thoughts. Their evaluation did not interfere with the actual testing of the instrument, as the second-year trainees were not working in GP training practices at the time of this study. After adjusting the items according to the second-year trainees&#x02019; feedback, we compiled the instrument for testing.</p><p>After we finalized the instrument, we asked first- and third-year trainees to complete it during one of their central curriculum sessions. A teacher (who, as mentioned, is not the clinical trainer) proctored the session to ensure that trainees would work independently as they assessed their clinical trainers as role models, and a research assistant collected the questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>We applied the three-step development process described above in order to evaluate the content validity<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> of the role model assessment instrument. We performed other tests, as described below, to examine the relationship between items, reliability, convergent validity, and known-group comparison on the instrument. We performed all data analyses using SPSS 16 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p><p>To test for relationships between items, we conducted a principal component analysis. We verified the sampling adequacy by calculating the participant-to-item ratio and using the Kaiser&#x02013;Meyer&#x02013;Olkin measure. We assessed multicollinearity examining the determinant (R) of the R-matrix, and we evaluated the correlation between variables, using the significance of the Bartlett's test.</p><p>We extracted components using oblique rotation (direct oblimin method). Using a scree plot, we established the number of components that should be retained, and we ran an analysis to obtain components with eigenvalues greater than 1, based on the Kaiser's criterion. We described the relative variance accounted for by each factor. Adopting alpha scores greater than 0.7 as an indication of good reliability, we calculated the Cronbach's alpha scores in order to assess the internal consistency of the retained components.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>We also asked the trainees to complete the CCTEI<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> on the same clinical trainer they assessed with our instrument. We used the CCTEI because it contains items that do not interfere with the attributes for role modeling (e.g., &#x0201c;Coaches me on my clinical/technical skills&#x0201d;); because, like our instrument, it was unfamiliar to the respondents; and because it was developed to evaluate clinical faculty and to provide feedback to clinician&#x02013;educators so they might improve their teaching. The known internal consistency of the CCTEI is high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.97).</p><p>Using descriptive statistics, we elaborated the scores for both instruments. In comparison with the CCTEI, we determined the convergent construct validity with the Spearman's rank correlation test. We expected a high correlation between the CCTEI and the Role Model Apperception Tool (RoMAT) because both instruments evaluate the competence of the clinical trainer for the learning process of the trainee.</p><p>According to the method of known-groups comparison, we evaluated the instrument&#x02019;s ability to discriminate between the less and more experienced trainees using nonparametrical testing (Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test). Previous studies showed that trainees who recently started their training were more likely to report the importance of personal characteristics and the learning environment, whereas more experienced trainees emphasized the clinical skills and the ability to transfer them.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>We also thought, given previous studies,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> that we might detect differences between male and female trainees.

Two focus group sessions involving, respectively, 10 and 8 second-year trainees (13 women and 5 men), resulted in the elimination of 3 items, the acceptance of 10 items with no change, the reformulation of 4 items, and (to increase their clarity) the addition of a few words to 3 other items.

The RoMAT consists of two components&#x02014;Caring Attitude and Effectiveness&#x02014;both of which include an equal number of items addressing personal, teaching, and clinical qualities, indicating that competence in all 3Hs is a condition for positive role modeling.</p><p>Although the RoMAT may serve as an instrument to identify educators who exemplify positive role models, characteristics of the trainees have to be taken into account. Our analyses revealed a significant difference in the Caring Attitude scores between less and more experienced trainees. Previous researchers<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> have also observed this difference; just-starting trainees tend to focus on the personal qualities of their clinical trainers and the learning climate, whereas more experienced trainees tend to concentrate on the professional competence and teaching skills of their clinical trainers. Nevertheless, the greater attention just-starting trainees give to personal characteristics does not fully explain the higher Caring Attitude scores these trainees assigned their trainers. Given that GPs in the Netherlands are free to choose to work as clinical trainers, those who do elect this option are likely to have a caring attitude toward just-starting trainees. This process of natural selection could have caused the relatively high scores on the instrument in general, and on the Caring Attitude score in particular. In addition, given their uncertainty regarding what is to be expected, it seems obvious that just-starting trainees may be very sensitive to their learning environment, as well as to the attitude of their trainers toward others. This sensitivity is in contrast to that of trainees who have more working experience and may focus on their future as independent physicians, thus experiencing a greater need for and attending more to professional skills.</p><p>Elzubeir and Rizk<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> conducted a study in a medical school in the United Arab Emirates and discovered that men assign more importance than women to &#x0201c;friendliness&#x0201d; (which is one item in the Caring Attitude component) as a characteristic for a role model. Elzubeir and Rizk anticipated this gender difference because female trainees in Middle Eastern culture are not likely to give their predominantly male role models a high score for friendliness. In their study, women rated nine characteristics (which collectively fall both within the Caring Attitude and the Effectiveness component) as more important than men rated them.</p><p>Even though the majority of trainees in our study were female and the majority of trainers were male (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), we detected no sex differences in how trainees rated their trainers. Our results are consistent with those of Wright and Carrese,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> who also found that gender has no influence on the identification of an excellent role model.</p><p>Despite the high correlation between the scores on the RoMAT and the CCTEI (<italic>r</italic> = 0.765), the CCTEI scores (mean 3.89 &#x000b1; SD 0.502) are lower than the RoMAT scores (mean 4.19 &#x000b1; SD 0.509). This difference is significant (<italic>t</italic> test, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001), indicating that the trainees can distinguish between their trainer as a teacher and their trainer as a role model on a trainer assessment, which in turn indicates that the RoMAT may serve as a possible tool for evaluating role model behavior. Furthermore, the trainees evaluated their clinical trainers with varied scores on the RoMAT items; their use of the full range of choices (from 1 to 5 on the Likert scale) indicates the RoMAT&#x02019;s capacity to reveal positive role modeling.</p><p>Given that the CCTEI measures teaching skills, trainees could be expected to assign high scores on the CCTEI for trainers who had attended teach-the-teacher courses. The GP clinical trainers assessed in our study included both new and very experienced trainers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). As demonstrated by Wright and Carrese,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> the completion of more teaching-training courses is not a condition for being identified as an &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d; role model. Moreover, as observed by Paice et al,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> regardless of teaching qualities, being a role model depends largely on what happens when clinical trainers are doing other things (i.e., not explicitly teaching). Because the RoMAT assesses qualities other than those addressed by the CCTEI, the scores can differ significantly.</p><p>We initially expected that the RoMAT would discriminate among three domains of qualities: personal, teaching, and clinical.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, however, the three domains are equally divided between two components (Caring Attitude and Effectiveness), thus demonstrating that competence in all 3Hs is a condition for positive role modeling.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Because completing the RoMAT was voluntary, selection bias is a possibility. The nonparticipation of any trainees who were not satisfied with the role-modeling behavior of their clinical trainers and who refused to participate because they feared the consequences of their evaluations could have had a positive influence on the total scores; however, the scores, reflecting the full range of 1 to 5 on the Likert scale, suggest that this was not the case.</p><p>We tested the RoMAT in a primary care setting where only one or two clinical trainers are available for each trainee. All of the GPs in our study voluntary chose to become clinical trainers. Additional research could reveal whether the RoMAT scores of trainees in other clinical settings, especially where multiple role models are available or where trainers have priorities other than working with trainees, would result in other components or in lower or more diverse and discriminating scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for research</title><p>As shown in a previous study,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> role-modeling behavior can improve after the role model receives feedback on role model assessments. The RoMAT could be similarly used for evaluating and providing feedback to clinical trainers, thus helping them to improve their own role-modeling behavior. Further research is necessary to determine whether improvement would be represented with higher scores on the RoMAT. Wright and colleagues<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> have suggested that education or training, adjusted to address the identified attributes, could improve the clinical trainer&#x02019;s role model behavior. Therefore, further research may show if integrating targeted role model behavior training into a curriculum for clinical trainers would, as evaluated by trainees using the RoMAT, result in higher scores.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The RoMAT has proven to be a valid and reliable instrument for assessing the role model behavior of clinical trainers. Educational managers, such as program directors, can use the RoMAT to improve clinical trainers&#x02019; awareness of their work as role models. Trainees can also use the RoMAT to identify which aspects of their clinical trainers&#x02019; professional behavior they should emulate.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><italic>Acknowledgments:</italic> The
